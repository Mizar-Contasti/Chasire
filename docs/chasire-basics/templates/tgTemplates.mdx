tgTemplates are used to build nice structures in a Telegram Environment. These templates are created to work with Telegram.

### tgStructureTemplate

**fbStructureTemplate help us to create a custom Structure**

> - You can use whatever block you want but take in mind that you have to separate it with a separator (comma).
> - In order to make structure work, you can paste all the name's structures inside of structure, and the components required in the component array.
> - If you dont know already what to do with context please make it false and just declare contextBody as null. (You can find Context in doc).
> - External or Generic Blocks should be used inside of open/close Payloads.
> - Available tgBlocks are **image paragraph reply card** These can be located in blocks -> tgBlocks.
