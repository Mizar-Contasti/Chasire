# Blocks

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

In order to build responses we need to create an Specific JSON structure, Chasire has take care of this process in detail so thats why built structures.

These structures or Templates are build with Blocks, right now we are just going to give you a look about the blocks and what these look like.

Chasire by itself has many blocks, divided in some categories.

```shell
Chasire
└─── blocks
    │   separators
    │   webBlocks
```

Blocks by itself are not helpfull, you should use a template instead to create complex or desired structures, so you will need first take a look at the blocks and then take care of a template examples.
