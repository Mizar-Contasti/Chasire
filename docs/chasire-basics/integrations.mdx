Integrations Help us to Install or put our chatbot on different platforms.

Right now Chasire doesnt allow you to Integrate, cause these all are external process, but If helps you to easily build responses and handle request from our backend.

<TabItem value="web" label="Web">

## Web Environment

Web Development has by far, the most features, events and tools to handle a Chatbot.

Also its the main focus Integration of Chasire.

If you want to integrate your chatbot to a WebPage I recommend you use Dialogflow Messenger, check how to integrate [**HERE**](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/integrations/dialogflow-messenger) or check the Official Doc [**HERE**](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/integrations/dialogflow-messenger)

I encourage you to check Chasire Doc, give a look at the Tutorials and lets go.

<TabItem value="facebook" label="Facebook Messenger">

## Facebook Messenger

There are many ways to integrate our chatbot with Facebook Messenger, I recomend you to Try a native connection between Dialogflow + Facebook, you can check that [**HERE**](https://google.com)

If you got the connection successfull I encourage you to check Chasire Doc, Try the tutorials and lets go with some Fb Templates.

After that, when being in control of this part of DF and FM, check some provider or try to revalidate your business with Facebook in order to use the external Structures.

<TabItem value="telegram" label="Telegram">

## Telegram

Telegram has by far more functionalities than Facebook, not more than web but have specific facilities that makes it an amazing platform where a Chatbot could live.

Currently Chasire is on BETA for Telegram.

<TabItem value="WhatsApp" label="WhatsApp">

## WhatsApp

WhatsApp has a hard environment cause of high prices to use API, at the first time I recommend you to use simple Apps that can help us to connect WhatsApp with Dialogflow only for Text.

AutoResponder can help you to make this connection.

Currently you can use a Paragraph Block that is avaiable for Chasire right now, in addition you can get Parameters, values from the Request, use fallbacks and implement contexts. With these tools you can create an Amazing bot in the meantime.

<TabItem value="webApp" label="webApp">

## WebApp

Create your Chatbot in Dialogflow Messenger, after that you can create a APP with a WebView from Android Studio (for example). Then install on your Phone and there you got. You have a chatbot on your Phone as APP.

Check how to do That [**HERE**](https://google.com)
