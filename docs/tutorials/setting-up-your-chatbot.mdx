# Setting up your Chatbot

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

Get started by **Creating our chatbot Throught Dialogflow and Connecting to Chasire**.

{/* Or **Look at this Tutorial in Spanish** with **[Mizar](h)**. */}

## 1.- Create a Chatbot on Dialogflow CX

First Lets Create our Chatbot on Dialogflow [**HERE**](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/cx/projects)

> - When entering you should Create an Account on Google (If you don't have), after that you'll be moved to the Dialogflow Platform
> - If you are new in Dialogflow I recommend this Youtube Channel that have good to know Tutorials from zero to Hero [**HERE**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpVijIXbyeMP0ts18S0Qf3qcLPxCp9Pfz)
> - Then you Should create an Agent (Chatbot)
> - Type a Simple Hello on the Console (Right panel) and Wait for the response

If you got your Chatbot responded you Let's go to the next part!

## 2.- Setting Chasire & Bot Templates

Ask Chasire bot (The moon icon at the right down corner) to Download Chasire Library, try something like (I Wanna Download the library)
Or Click [**HERE**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11_YpgqY0HFFwzX5J0F-_tTg6YtNYqALe/view?usp=sharing)

==================================================

On your root folder, Unpack the file, and you will have a folder named Chatbots with Chasire and Sion(a chatbot template)

.

:::tip Keep in Mind

Remember that you need a PHP server Running online

:::

.

After that, your folders should have this order

```shell
root

â””â”€â”€â”€Chatbots
    â”‚   Chasire
    â”‚   Sion
```

Now, lets check that Sion (chatbot template) is requiring Chasire

Inside of the Folder of your ChatbotExample you should see some folders and some files, open the file named chatbotExample.php

If you imported successfully Chasire and ordered as shown before, you should see that this Chatbot is requiring Chasire, if you changed the routers/folders hierarchy, remember to change the path.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```php
require_once("../Chasire/Chasire.php");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 3.- Connecting Chatbot with Dialogflow

Once you imported successfully, right now your ChatbotExample knows how to handle Dialogflow, so we are going to Connect our ChatbotExample Backend with Dialogflow.

> - Go to Dialogflow CX, and in the option Manage enter into **Webhooks**
> - Create a webhook
> - In the URL path you should put the Chatbot core file, this should be  
>   'https:// rootDomain.com/chatbots/chatbotExample/chatbot.php'
> - We are going to use basicAuth so we need a Key and Password Values, move to your ChatbotExample Folder
> - Inside of the **core folder** you should see a file named **variables.php** Open It!
> - At the top there are two variables named chatbotName and chatbotPassword, these values are the key and the password
> - So you can type in the basic Auth, then press the Blue Save button at the bottom of the Page.

## 4.- Testing Chasire on Current Chatbot

Right now Chasire is connected to our Chatbot that is connected to Dialogflow, we just need Test the connection and we'll be done

##### Dialogflow Section

> - Create a Intent named test
> - On Training phrases put **'test'**
> - On Responses let's create a default response of **'Test ðŸ’¥'**
> - Then go down and open the section of Fulfillment and click on **Enable Webhook Call for this Intent**

##### Server Section

> - Go to your Chatbot Template folder and open the Intents Folder
> - Right here we should have all the Intents ordered by Category and other stuff that you can check on Documentation ðŸ˜‰
> - Open the file named test.php, you should be able to see some code like this.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```php
<?php
if(intent('test')){
  triggerError(false,['Message from the backend']);
}
?>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

###### Testing on Dialogflow

In order to test we should go right now to Dialogflow and type on the console the word **'test'**

If we got the response of **'Message from the backend'** Congratulations.
